# Armani Design System (Billboard.UI)

Welcome to the Armani Design System Library! This library is a collection of reusable components that have been carefully designed and developed to help us create consistent, high-quality projects.

The library is built using React and Ant Design, and includes a variety of components for building user interfaces, such as buttons, forms, tables, and more. In addition, we use Storybook to handle and showcase our components in an organized and easy-to-use way.

### Install Dependencies

 ```
 yarn install
 ```

### Building

This uses `rollup` to build:

```
yarn install
yarn run build
```

### Demo (storybook)

React Storybook is an easy way to develop components with real-time feedback, run in the browser. To run Storybook, just run:

```
yarn run storybook
```

Then go to: http://localhost:6006

### Usage

1. yarn add [package-name]
```

2. Enjoy!
